                    <h2>Welcome to Uttrakhand</h2>
                    <p>Uttarakhand was formed on the 9th November 2000 as the 27th State of India, when it was carved
                        out of northern Uttar Pradesh. Located at the foothills of the Himalayan mountain ranges, it is
                        largely a hilly State, having international boundaries with China (Tibet) in the north and Nepal
                        in the east. On its north-west lies Himachal Pradesh, while on the south is Uttar Pradesh. It is
                        rich in natural resources especially water and forests with many glaciers, rivers, dense forests
                        and snow-clad mountain peaks. Char-dhams, the four most sacred and revered Hindu temples of
                        Badrinath,Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri are nestled in the mighty mountains. It’s truly
                        God’s Land (Dev Bhoomi). Dehradun is the Capital of Uttarakhand. It is one of the most beautiful
                        resort in the submountain tracts of India, known for its scenic surroundings. The town lies in
                        the Dun Valley, on the watershed of the Ganga and Yamuna rivers.
